    "# Valid Anagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Thought Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Easiest, most naive way is to turn both strings into a list of characters, then sort them and compare. This is O(nlgn), so clearly not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better is to go through one word (`s`, WLOG), and count how many times each character appears. Then go through `t`, decrementing the character's counter every time we encounter a character. At the end, the whole dictionary should be completely zeroed out."
